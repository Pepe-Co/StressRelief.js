Stress Relief is a responsive CoffeeScript app written using the graphical library PIXI.js. Stress Relief allows users to upload images and decorate the image with a variety of interactive tools. 

Stress Relief is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and compiled to JavaScript, and is powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), and [Howler](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library).

Stress Relief uses the HTML5 canvas to allow for art and images to be drawn to the image.

It is an HTML5 open-source remake of [Gemtreeâ€™s](http://www.gemtree.com/) [Desktop Destroyer software](http://publisher.games.brothersoft.com/gemtree-software-total-download/)
